# ZoomLinks

Zoom links is a simple Python program that can automate sending e-mails to multiple people on an .xlsx file. 

How it works?

> You run the program
> Select the .xlsx file that contains NAME and EMAIL
> Paste the URL that you wanna send on your e-mail, which in my case, was Zoom recordings

What can you implement?

My first intention was to connect this with the Zoom API (https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/api-reference/zoom-api), so that i can automatically fetch the recordings,
and get the link of the last one, so when a new recording will pop, the program will run and send it to the corresponding people. 
I didn't do it because zoom really needs HTTPS to work with their API so that was red flag for the time that i had lol. 

Also, you can add some graphic interface to this, because at the time i'm running the program from terminal, which is not bad but it might be hard to understand 
for the average people. 

I'm uploading this so maybe someone can start from the point that i left make something else, byebye<3
